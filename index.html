<h1>Face Changer for Android</h1>

<div class="main-body">

<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
This project will begin as a face swapping application on Android. If time permits, I will expand it to add additional filters and processing affects that can be applied to live video feedback from the Android's front facing camera. The project will be open-source and open-license and will be available on Github for future expansion.
</p>

<h2>Resources and Potential Techniques</h2>
<p>
There are two primary challenge of this project: facial recognition and orientation alignment. Though the facial recognition aspect is self-evident, the need for orientation alignment may be less obvious. Once two faces are recognized, in order to produce reasonable and convincing face-swapping results, they will need to be aligned to the orientation of their respective target faces. At this time, I believe that the landmark based 2D orientation detection using unit quaternions from Horn 1987 and described in class in a reasonable algorithm for accomplishing this. For facial landmark detection, I may begin by using the dlib c++ toolkit, which includes a robust implementation for faces looking directly at the camera. I would like to do additional research into methods for more sophisticated methods of facial landmark detection, but based on what we have learned so far I may consider implementing my own version based on template matching or a similar technique. Finally, I believe that the swapped faces would benefit from histogram normalization to the target face so that the face colors are in closer alignment with the surrounding skin of the target.

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>
Currently, I have developed a base Android project that accesses the video stream from the front camera. I have also setup the project such that native C++ code can be used for the image processing. This will allow cross compatibility for the primary technical component of the project. Additionally, I have researched the previously described techniques and am ready to begin implementing the necessary algorithms.
